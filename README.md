# Abstract
A large community-based mass trial is highly needed to determine the full spectrum of effects of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) treatment. A cluster-randomized, controlled mass intervention trial was launched in March 2011 in Linqu county, China, enrolling a total of 180,284 eligible subjects, which were aged 25-54 years, free of major illness, and without having received prior H.pylori treatment. A double-blinded block stratified cluster randomization scheme was implemented across 980 villages, with individuals who tested positive for H.pylori using a 13C-urea breath test randomly assigned to either receiving a 10-day quadruple anti-H.pylori treatment or symptom alleviation treatment with single dosage of omeprazole and bismuth citrate. We examined the incidence of GC as the primary outcome. During 11.8 years’ follow-up (2011-2022), 1035 incident GC cases were documented. Individuals receiving anti-H.pylori therapy had a statistically significant reduction in GC incidence in the intention-to-treat analyses (HR=0.86, 95%CI=0.74-0.99), with stronger effect observed for those having successful H.pylori eradication (HR=0.81, 95%CI=0.69-0.96) than failed treatment. The beneficial effect of successful eradication was particularly noteworthy for individuals aged 25-45 years, with 35% decreased GC incidence (HR=0.65, 95%CI=0.46-0.93). We report a significant reduction in GC incidence by H.pylori treatment, endorsing H.pylori mass screening and eradication as a public health policy for GC prevention.
